        John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became
        widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in
        skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with
        several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia
        and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording
        techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged
        as \"Beatlemania\"; as the group''s music grew in sophistication, led by primary
        songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music''s evolution
        into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.",

        instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles'' work. Although

        and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the bass guitarist and singer for
        the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential
        group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon
        was the most successful of the post-war era. After the group disbanded in
        1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife,
        Linda, and Denny Laine.\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers
        and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles
        song \"Yesterday\", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music
        history. Wings'' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling
        singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
        (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an
        18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs
        that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of  2009 he
        had 25.5\u00a0million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney,
        Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members
        of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted

        are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group''s
        original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their
        cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal
        harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts
        of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s
        rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian
        as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical
        elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.\nThe
        Beach Boys began as a garage band, managed by the Wilsons'' father Murry,
        with Brian''s musicianship dominating their creative direction. In 1963, they
        gained national prominence with a string of top-ten hits reflecting a southern
        California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, later dubbed the \"California
        Sound\". After 1964, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics
        and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\"
        single raised the group''s prestige as rock innovators and established the
        band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era. Following the dissolution
        of the group''s Smile project in 1967, Brian gradually ceded production and
        songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of
        mental health and substance abuse issues. The group''s commercial momentum
        subsequently faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound,
        they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archetypal \"pop music cop-outs\".\n",

        Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide
        fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually
        for one song on an album, including \"With a Little Help from My Friends\",
        \"Yellow Submarine\", \"Good Night\", and their cover of \"Act Naturally\".
        He also wrote the Beatles'' songs \"Don''t Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus''s Garden\",

        was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell
        behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held
        a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool
        equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle
        craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded
        his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious
        local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early
        1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool
        group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in
        the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August

        writing original material, a decision with which Jones did not agree. Jones
        left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been
        replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band,
