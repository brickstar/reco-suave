        John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became
        widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in
        skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with
        several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia
        and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording
        techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged
        as \"Beatlemania\"; as the group''s music grew in sophistication, led by primary
        songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music''s evolution
        into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.",

        the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential
        group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon
        was the most successful of the post-war era. After the group disbanded in
        1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife,
        Linda, and Denny Laine.\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers

        original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their
        cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal
        harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts
        of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s
        rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian
        as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical

        gained national prominence with a string of top-ten hits reflecting a southern
        California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, later dubbed the \"California
        Sound\". After 1964, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics
        and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\"
        single raised the group''s prestige as rock innovators and established the
        band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era. Following the dissolution
        of the group''s Smile project in 1967, Brian gradually ceded production and
        songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of
        mental health and substance abuse issues. The group''s commercial momentum
        subsequently faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound,

        was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell
        behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held
        a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool
        equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle
        craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded
        his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious
        local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early
        1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool
        group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in

        (January 8, 1935\u00a0\u2013 August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor.
        Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,
        he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply the \"King\".\nPresley
        was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with
        his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954,
        recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the
        sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist
        Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly,
        an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues.
        In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley''s
        classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by
        Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley''s
        first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became
        a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network
        television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure
        of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations
        of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly
        potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in
        race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.\n", "wUrl":

        group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and
        keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band''s heavy, guitar-driven
        sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their
        style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia,
        and folk music.\nAfter changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin
        signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic
        freedom. Although the group were initially unpopular with critics, they achieved
        significant commercial success with eight studio albums released over eleven
        years, from Led Zeppelin (1969) to In Through the Out Door (1979). Their untitled
